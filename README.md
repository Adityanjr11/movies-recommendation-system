🎬 Movie Recommendation System
A content-based movie recommendation engine built with Python, NLTK, and Streamlit. This project uses natural language processing to suggest movies based on tags, genres, and overviews from a Kaggle dataset.

📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to recommend the top 5 most similar movies to a user-selected title.

Preprocessing: Done in Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration and cleaning.

NLP: Utilizes NLTK for text preprocessing (Stemming).

Model: Cosine Similarity is used to calculate the distance between movie vectors.

Frontend: A sleek web interface built with Streamlit.
