🎬 Movie Recommendation SystemA content-based recommendation engine developed using NLP and Machine Learning. This project transitions from data exploration in Jupyter to a production-ready web interface using Streamlit and PyCharm.Getty Images Explore 📌 Project OverviewThe system analyzes movie metadata (genres, keywords, cast, and crew) to find similarities between films. It transforms text data into vectors and calculates the mathematical "distance" between them to suggest the most relevant content.Dataset: TMDB 5,000 Movie Dataset (Kaggle).Algorithm: Cosine Similarity.NLP: Stemming and Vectorization.🛠️ Tech StackComponentTool / LibraryLanguagePython 3.xIDEPyCharmEnvironmentJupyter NotebookNLPNLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)ML LibrariesPandas, Scikit-learn, NumPyFrontendStreamlit🏗️ Workflow1. Data Exploration (Jupyter)Loaded datasets from Kaggle.Merged movies and credits dataframes.Cleaned missing values and duplicated entries.2. Natural Language Processing (NLTK)Tagging: Concatenated genres, keywords, overview, cast, and crew into a single tags column.Stemming: Used PorterStemmer from NLTK to reduce words to their root form (e.g., "activities" → "activ").Vectorization: Converted text to 5,000-dimensional vectors using CountVectorizer (Bag of Words).3. Model BuildingCalculated Cosine Similarity scores between all movie vectors.Exported the similarity matrix and movie list as .pkl (Pickle) files for the web app.🚀 Installation & Usage1.
